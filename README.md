Polygon (previously Matic Network) is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that aims to enhance its scalability and usability. It provides a framework for building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks. The project seeks to address some of Ethereum's limitations, such as high gas fees and slow transaction times, by offloading transactions onto sidechains while maintaining the security and decentralization of the Ethereum mainnet.
